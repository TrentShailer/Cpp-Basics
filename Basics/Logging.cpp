// Logging to console may look complicated but its pretty easy
// First include iostream
#include <iostream>

// Then write your log statement
std::cout << "Text to log" << std::endl;
// This will print 'Text to log' to your console

// You can also log variables
float distance = 2.2;
std::cout << "The distance is: " << i << "m" << std::endl;
// Will print 'The distance is 2.2m'

// notice how each segment is separeted by <<
